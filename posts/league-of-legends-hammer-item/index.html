Despite her small stature, Poppy has the ability to deliver powerful blows and bring disruption to the battlefield with her crowd control abilities. Her mission is to find the rightful wielder of the legendary hammer she carries, and she ventures into the realm of Terra in pursuit of her goal.\nPoppy’s Abilities Passive: Iron Ambassador - Poppy throws her buckler as a basic attack, gaining range, bonus magic damage, and applying on-hit effects. She can pick up her buckler to gain a shield, but it can be destroyed if an enemy walks over it. If her buckler kills a target, it returns to Poppy automatically.\nQ: Hammer Shock - Poppy smashes the ground, dealing percentage max health damage and slowing enemies in a small area. After a moment, the ground erupts, dealing the same damage again. Using Hammer Shock while laning can be effective for trading with opponents, especially if you can land the aftershock.\nW: Steadfast Presence - This ability has both passive and active components. Passively, Poppy gains bonus armor and magic resist, which increases when she is low on health. When activated, Steadfast Presence grants Poppy movement speed and creates a magic barrier around her, stopping enemy dashes and damaging anyone struck. However, it can’t stop blinks like Flash or Ezreal’s Arcane Shift.\nE: Heroic Charge - Poppy tackles an enemy, damaging and carrying them forward. If the enemy collides with terrain, Poppy deals additional damage and stuns them. Utilizing terrain strategically can lead to stunning an opponent and setting up kills for your team.\nR: Keeper’s Verdict - Poppy rears back for a mighty blow with her hammer. On the second cast, she unleashes a massive smash, battering enemies towards their own Nexus. This ability can hit multiple enemies in a small area around the first champion struck. The longer the channel, the farther the knock back. It’s worth noting that enemies in the air are untargetable until the knock back ends.\nPlaying as Poppy Laning Phase - Use Hammer Shock to punish opponents when they go for last hits. If you can land the aftershock, you can chunk a significant portion of their health, giving you an advantage in trades. Keep an eye out for opportunities to stun enemies using Heroic Charge by utilizing terrain.\nTeamfights - Poppy excels in tight areas of the map. Steadfast Presence’s movement speed and Heroic Charge’s wall slam can ensure both hits of Hammer Shock, resulting in an easy kill. Poppy can also act as a shield for her team, preventing enemies from dashing past or away from her allies. This allows champions like Annie and Caitlyn to deal damage uninterrupted.\nKeeper’s Verdict - Poppy’s ultimate ability is a game-changer. It can be used to displace enemies and control teamfights. However, it requires careful positioning and timing to maximize its effectiveness. Proper usage of Keeper’s Verdict can turn the tide of a battle, while misuse can result in undesired outcomes.\nPoppy’s Tactics in Action Tower Dive - In one scenario, Poppy encounters Lee Sin in the jungle. She uses Heroic Charge to pin him against the wall, preventing him from escaping. Steadfast Presence acts as a barrier, preventing Lee Sin from using his safeguard ability to retreat. Poppy’s iron ambassador buckler applies a slow, making it easier to land Heroic Charge on Bard, who is unable to escape. After Bard falls, Poppy turns her attention to Tristana, charging a minion instead of Tristana herself. This forces Tristana to use her flash, blocking her escape and securing an advantageous situation for Poppy’s team.\nAgainst Cast and Shen - Poppy is confronted by Cast and Shen. She strategically uses Steadfast Presence to stop their dashes and knock them back with Keeper’s Verdict. This creates space for her team to engage and prevents the enemy from making plays.\nIn conclusion, Poppy, the hammer-wielding champion, brings a mix of damage, crowd control, and disruption to League of Legends. Her abilities allow for strategic play and can create opportunities for her team to secure kills and turn the tide of battles. Mastering her abilities and effectively utilizing her ultimate, Keeper’s Verdict, is essential to achieving success on the battlefield. Become the wielder of the legendary hammer and let Poppy show you the way to victory.\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the Riot Games YouTube channel and leave any comments or feedback below the video.
