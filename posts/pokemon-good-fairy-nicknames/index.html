One of the more recent additions to the Pok√©mon series is the Fairy type, which was introduced in Pok√©mon X and Y. Since their introduction, Fairy-type Pok√©mon have become a diverse and interesting group, ranging from delicate and magical creatures to powerful behemoths. In this article, we will be exploring every Fairy-type Pok√©mon, ranking them based on their strengths in battle. So, join us as we dive into the world of Fairy-type Pok√©mon and discover which ones are the weakest and which ones are the most powerful.\nWeakest Fairy-Type Pok√©mon: Mawile When it comes to Fairy-type Pok√©mon, looks can be deceiving. One Pok√©mon that embodies this saying is Mawile, the Deceiver Pok√©mon. With its sharp teeth and intimidating appearance, one would expect Mawile to be a formidable opponent. However, its stats cap out at a mere 380, making it one of the weakest Fairy-type Pok√©mon. While its base attack of 85 is its highest stat, it still falls short when compared to other Pok√©mon. Mawile‚Äôs Pokedex entries mention its ability to trick others before launching a successful attack. Unfortunately, this deceptive tactic doesn‚Äôt make up for its lack of power, earning it a spot at the bottom of our ranking.\nThe Illuminating Pok√©mon: Shiinotic Line Next up in our ranking is the Shiinotic line, known as the Illuminating Pok√©mon. While the Shiinotic line may not be exclusive in terms of evolution, their prowess in battle is not their strong suit. The first Pok√©mon in this line, Morelull, has a total of 285 in stats, making it one of the weakest Pok√©mon out there. Even when it evolves into Shiinotic, its stats only reach a maximum of 405, with its special defense being its best stat at 100. Similar to Mawile, the Shiinotic line prefers using spores to cause their enemies to fall asleep rather than engaging in head-to-head battles.\nThe Aqua Rabbit Pok√©mon: Azumarill Line Moving on to the Aqua Rabbit Pok√©mon, the Azumarill line, we find Azurill, the first Pok√©mon in this line, as one of the weakest Fairy-type Pok√©mon. With a pitiful maxed-out stat of 190, Azurill doesn‚Äôt hold up in terms of power. However, after it evolves into Marill, it gains a power boost, but even at its strongest, its stat ranking doesn‚Äôt exceed 420. Despite the Azumarill line‚Äôs ability to reduce damage from fire and ice type moves, it falls short in terms of overall strength.\nThe Antenna Pok√©mon: Dedenne Dedenne, the Antenna Pok√©mon, may look like a cute fairy Pikachu clone, but its strength in battle is underwhelming. With a total stat of only 431, Dedenne‚Äôs only standout attribute is its decent speed. However, when it comes to overall strength among Fairy-type Pok√©mon, it falls short.\nThe Balloon Pok√©mon: Wigglytuff Line The Wigglytuff line, known as the Balloon Pok√©mon, may have impressive singing prowess, but it isn‚Äôt particularly strong in battles. Igglybuff, the first Pok√©mon in this trio, only has a total stat of 210, outranking Azurill by a mere 20 points. Jigglypuff, on the other hand, has its highest stat in HP but lacks in attack and defense. Even with Wigglytuff‚Äôs added attack and special attack stats, it still doesn‚Äôt surpass 435 in total stats.\nThe Deceptive Duo: Snubbull and Granbull The Snubbull and Granbull duo may give off an intimidating vibe with their grumpy expressions, but their strength in battle is lacking. Snubbull and Granbull have decent attack stats, but their defense and speed are lacking. With maximum stats reaching 450, Snubbull and Granbull find themselves lower in the ranking due to their lack of quickness and defense.\nThe Barrier Pok√©mon: Mr. Mime Line The Mr. Mime line, known as the Barrier Pok√©mon, starts off with Mime Jr., one of the strongest baby Pok√©mon. With a maxed-out stat of 310, Mime Jr. surpasses other baby Pok√©mon in terms of strength. However, when it evolves into Mr. Mime, its attack and HP stats remain low, with maximum stats of 460. Known for creating walls out of thin air, Mr. Mime‚Äôs strongest stat is its special defense at 120. While it provides a decent shield in battle, it falls short in other areas, earning its spot in the ranking.\nThe Fragrance Pok√©mon: Aromatisse Line Coming from the Kalos region, the Aromatisse line, known as the Fragrance Pok√©mon, is surprisingly tougher than it looks. With Spritzee and Aromatisse having large eyes resembling plague doctor masks, they may seem delicate, but their stats tell a different story. While Spritzee‚Äôs attacking abilities may not be impressive, its special defense and HP stats are decent for a first-stage Pok√©mon, with a maxed-out stat of 341. When Aromatisse evolves, its special attack receives a significant boost, making it a solid Fairy-type Pok√©mon. However, even at its strongest, its maximum stat only reaches 462.\nThe Bee Pok√©mon: Ribombee Compared to previous entries, Ribombee, the Bee Pok√©mon, excels in speed. Its stats, aside from speed, may not be remarkable, with a total stat of 464. However, with the right moveset, Ribombee can utilize its speed and special attack power effectively, making it a valuable addition to a team.\nThe Key Ring Pok√©mon: Klefki Klefki, the Key Ring Pok√©mon, is known for keeping its trainer‚Äôs keys safe. In battle, however, Klefki proves to be more than just a guardian of keys. With well-rounded stats that peak at a total of 470, including a strong defense stat of 91, Klefki can hold its own in battles.\nThe Disguise Pok√©mon: Mimikyu Mimikyu, the Disguise Pok√©mon, is a beloved Pok√©mon in the series, despite its mysterious appearance beneath its homemade costume. In battle, Mimikyu proves its strength with decent attack, special defense, and speed stats. With a total stat of 476, Mimikyu‚Äôs ability, Disguise, further enhances its battle capabilities. However, once its disguise is broken, it needs to be healed to regain its full potential.\nThe Dog Pok√©mon: Dedenne and Granbull One of the most popular evolutionary lines in the Alola region, the Dedenne and Granbull line is known for its ability to help wheat grow and the pleasant scent of freshly baked bread. While Furfrou may not excel in terms of stats, with a total stat of 312, Granbull is more impressive with a total of 477. With its ability, Well-Baked Body, Granbull becomes immune to fire-type moves and gains a boost to its defense stat. When used strategically, both Pok√©mon can prove their worth on the battlefield.\nThe Wind Veiled Pok√©mon: Whimsicott Line The Whimsicott line, known as the Wind Veiled Pok√©mon, may not look like strong Fairy-type Pok√©mon at first glance, but appearances can be deceiving. Cottony, the first Pok√©mon in this line, may have low stats, but it evolves into Whimsicott, which boasts a total stat of 480. While Whimsicott‚Äôs speed is its standout attribute, its other stats are nothing to overlook, making it a formidable opponent in battles.\nConclusion In conclusion, Fairy-type Pok√©mon come in various shapes and sizes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. From the deceiving Mawile to the powerful Whimsicott, Fairy-type Pok√©mon offer an interesting mix in battle. While some may lack in certain areas, others prove to be formidable opponents. Whether you are a fan of the delicate and magical Fairy types or prefer the true behemoths, there is a Fairy-type Pok√©mon for everyone. So, go out there and catch ‚Äôem all!\n","wordCount":"1234","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"James Allan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/pokemon-good-fairy-nicknames/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Every FAIRY-Type Pok√©mon: Weak to Powerful üßö</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 29, 2023</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;1234 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;James Allan</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#weakest-fairy-type-pok√©mon-mawile>Weakest Fairy-Type Pok√©mon: Mawile</a></li><li><a href=#the-illuminating-pok√©mon-shiinotic-line>The Illuminating Pok√©mon: Shiinotic Line</a></li><li><a href=#the-aqua-rabbit-pok√©mon-azumarill-line>The Aqua Rabbit Pok√©mon: Azumarill Line</a></li><li><a href=#the-antenna-pok√©mon-dedenne>The Antenna Pok√©mon: Dedenne</a></li><li><a href=#the-balloon-pok√©mon-wigglytuff-line>The Balloon Pok√©mon: Wigglytuff Line</a></li><li><a href=#the-deceptive-duo-snubbull-and-granbull>The Deceptive Duo: Snubbull and Granbull</a></li><li><a href=#the-barrier-pok√©mon-mr-mime-line>The Barrier Pok√©mon: Mr. Mime Line</a></li><li><a href=#the-fragrance-pok√©mon-aromatisse-line>The Fragrance Pok√©mon: Aromatisse Line</a></li><li><a href=#the-bee-pok√©mon-ribombee>The Bee Pok√©mon: Ribombee</a></li><li><a href=#the-key-ring-pok√©mon-klefki>The Key Ring Pok√©mon: Klefki</a></li><li><a href=#the-disguise-pok√©mon-mimikyu>The Disguise Pok√©mon: Mimikyu</a></li><li><a href=#the-dog-pok√©mon-dedenne-and-granbull>The Dog Pok√©mon: Dedenne and Granbull</a></li><li><a href=#the-wind-veiled-pok√©mon-whimsicott-line>The Wind Veiled Pok√©mon: Whimsicott Line</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qv3EptgqPYQ style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In the world of Pok√©mon, there are many different types of Pok√©mon with unique strengths and weaknesses.
