This article will guide you through the game, offering tips and strategies to help you make the right choices and achieve financial stability. From finding a job to managing expenses, we’ve got you covered. So let’s dive in and get started!\nStep 1: Finding a Job In the Spent Game, you start off with no job and only a thousand dollars to your name. Your first priority is to find employment. There are several options available to you:\nWarehouse Job: This job requires physical labor, with a shift from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. You will earn $9 per hour, but there are risks involved, such as the potential for injuries and healthcare costs.\nRestaurant Server: If you have experience in the restaurant industry, you can work as a server at a casual restaurant. The wage is $2.13 per hour, but you have the opportunity to earn more through tips. The working hours are Tuesday through Friday, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.\nOffice Temp: If you are familiar with office work, this could be a good option for you. The pay is $9 per hour, and the working hours vary. Temporary positions can often lead to more permanent opportunities.\nConsider the pros and cons of each job before making your decision. Will you prioritize stability, potential earnings, or flexibility?\nStep 2: Managing your Finances Once you have chosen a job, it’s important to keep track of your income and expenses. The Spent Game simulates real-life financial challenges, so careful planning is required. Here are some key points to remember:\nPaydays and Taxes: You will receive your salary on specific days indicated on the screen. Keep track of these dates. Remember to factor in taxes, as they will be automatically deducted from your paycheck. In the game, taxes include the Uncle Sam’s income tax, state taxes, and local taxes.\nHealth Insurance: In the Spent Game, you are required to have health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). You have several options: the Gold, Silver, or Bronze plan, each with different costs and coverage levels. Alternatively, you can choose to opt-out of health insurance but be aware that you will face a monthly penalty of $12.\nHousing: Choose a place to live based on your budget and location preferences. Remember that proximity to work affects rent prices. Living closer to the city may be more expensive, but it could also save you money on transportation costs. Consider your overall monthly expenses and make a decision that fits your financial situation.\nStep 3: Making Smart Choices Throughout the game, you will face various challenges and unexpected events that require decision-making. Here are a few examples from the game:\nCar Accident: Imagine you accidentally damage someone’s car while driving. The repair costs are high, and you can’t afford to pay. In the game, you have the option to either pay for the damage or drive away. This decision will impact your finances and moral standing.\nExtra Expenses: You may encounter situations where you need to spend money on unexpected expenses. For instance, your child may need new sneakers or want to join an after-school sports team. It’s important to weigh the financial impact of these choices and prioritize your budget accordingly.\nGrocery Shopping: One of the main challenges in the Spent Game is managing your food budget. You will need to buy groceries that can last you a week. Make wise choices based on your budget, opting for affordable options like beans, ramen noodles, and bread. Don’t forget essentials like toilet paper!\nRemember, every decision you make affects your financial stability. Think carefully and consider the long-term consequences of your choices.\nStep 4: Reflection and Learning After completing 30 days in the Spent Game, it’s time to reflect on your experience and what you’ve learned. Whether you successfully made it through the month or faced financial difficulties, take a moment to analyze your strategies and decisions. Consider what you could have done differently and how you can apply these lessons in real-life situations.\nSubmitting a screenshot of your final results can be a valuable way to document your progress and share your experience with others.\nConclusion The Spent Game provides an eye-opening experience on the challenges of managing money and making financial decisions. By following the steps and strategies outlined in this article, you can improve your chances of survival and success in the game. Remember to prioritize your expenses, be mindful of your choices, and learn from your experiences.\nSo, are you ready to take on the Spent Game and prove your financial prowess? Play the game, learn from your mistakes, and watch your virtual bank account grow. Good luck!\nNote: This article is a walkthrough of the Spent Game and does not provide real-life financial advice.\n","wordCount":"817","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeffrey Ringrose"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/spent-game-walkthrough/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Survive and Succeed in the Spent Game: A Comprehensive Walkthrough</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 21, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;817 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jeffrey Ringrose</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#step-1-finding-a-job>Step 1: Finding a Job</a></li><li><a href=#step-2-managing-your-finances>Step 2: Managing your Finances</a></li><li><a href=#step-3-making-smart-choices>Step 3: Making Smart Choices</a></li><li><a href=#step-4-reflection-and-learning>Step 4: Reflection and Learning</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aTlHxPq-b-4 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Are you ready to test your financial skills and see if you can survive a month in the Spent Game?
