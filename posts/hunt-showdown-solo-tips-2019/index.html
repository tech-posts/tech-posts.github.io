These tips are aimed at both new players and veterans, so everyone can benefit from them. Please note that this guide was recorded during the 1.0 release, so some information may not be viable in later patches. Let’s dive right in and discover how you can dominate the world of Hunt Showdown!\nKey Points Here are the key points that we will be covering in this article:\nSpawning near documents and chicken coops Clearing doghouses and chicken coops Dealing with horses and engines Recognizing broken clues Understanding red glowing clues Using crows to your advantage Decoying enemy hunters with crows Recognizing head shots Opening barricaded doors Breaking doors efficiently Strategies for dealing with enemies Opening doors quietly Quick reloads with certain weapons Understanding the mechanics of hunters Dropping metal gates Dealing with the Immolator enemies The perfect timing for killing Marion tanks The power of charging with the Immolator The reduced damage on teammates The danger of explosive damage on teammates Recognizing different hitboxes on hunters Understanding the map size The impact of gunshots on the map Understanding what the Devil’s Cost is Killing ducks efficiently Checking ammo boxes and med kits Understanding bear traps and wire traps The effect of bullet damage drop Consider bullet travel time Recognizing boss aggro Healing while poisoned The impact of aim punch Flash point damage Spawn near Documents and Chicken Coops One strategy to enter a compound quietly is to spawn near documents and chicken coops. By knowing if the door counts and chicken coops are empty, you can ensure a silent approach. If the doors and chicken coops are red, it means that animals such as dogs and chickens are present. On the other hand, if they are gray, they will be empty.\nClearing Doghouses and Chicken Coops To clear doghouses and chicken coops, you can use a lantern to scare away the pesky animals. Make sure to aim at the center of the lantern to ensure the animals flee. If some of the animals are left alive, they will start alerting others in your vicinity. Another option is to turn off the lantern and break the lamp above the camp. You can also use decoys or throwing knives to distract the animals.\nDealing with Horses and Engines Horses and engines can be a vulnerable part of the environment, as they can alert enemies around you. It is important to note that small caliber weapons may not kill them with a single body shot. However, high damage weapons like a crossbow can take them down with one shot. Alternatively, you can use throwing knives to kill them quietly by aiming for a specific body part.\nRecognizing Broken Clues If you come across a clue with a broken seal, it indicates that other players have already been in the area. This can be a useful piece of information to know if someone has already been to that location.\nUnderstanding Red Glowing Clues When hunters are close by, clues will glow red. This is an indication that other players are in the vicinity and can help you plan your approach accordingly. However, this only applies if you haven’t found the boss yet. Once the boss is banished and the clue is picked up, the red glowing effect will disappear.\nUtilizing Crows to Your Advantage Crows can be used as a strategic tool to identify the movement of enemy hunters. By triggering them to fly away from the source, you can predict the direction in which the enemy hunters are heading.\nDecoying Enemy Hunters with Crows Another interesting tactic is to use crows as decoys. By intentionally triggering them to fly in the opposite direction of where you are going, you can confuse and trick pursuing hunters into thinking that other players are approaching them.\nRecognizing Head Shots Headshots have a unique sound effect in Hunt Showdown. By listening carefully, you can differentiate between headshots and body shots. This information can be crucial in determining the effectiveness of your shots.\nOpening Barricaded Doors Did you know that you can open barricaded doors by shooting the bar behind them? This method is not effective from the front of the door, but it can save you time and effort in opening doors from the other side.\nBreaking Doors Efficiently If you need to break a door quickly, the most efficient method is to use melee weapons available in the open world. Their high damage output allows you to break doors in a short amount of time. This can be especially useful when trying to enter buildings while being pursued.\nStrategies for Dealing with Enemies Grunts and Hives can be crippled to slow them down. By dealing with them strategically, you can gain an advantage in combat.\nOpening Doors Quietly If you want to open doors quietly, crouching while opening them will minimize noise. This can be a smart move when you don’t want to alert nearby enemies to your presence. However, keep in mind that opening doors while crouching is slower.\nQuick Reloads with Certain Weapons Some weapons, such as the Mosin, the Dolch, and the Bornheim, allow for quick reloads using stripper clips. This technique can save you time and potentially turn the tide of a battle. However, be cautious about reloading with only one bullet left, as your hunter will perform a stripper clip reload animation. It is advisable to reload bullet for bullet unless your weapon is completely empty.\nUnderstanding the Mechanics of Hunters Hunters in Hunt Showdown have different hitboxes, including legs, arms, torso, and head. Depending on which body part you hit, different multipliers will be applied to your damage. Understanding these hitboxes can help you optimize your shots and increase your chances of eliminating enemies efficiently.\nDropping Metal Gates Metal gates can be dropped by taking a single point of damage to them. This technique can be useful in both offensive and defensive strategies. If you are running away from enemies, you can run through these gates and then drop them to gain extra time to retreat. Conversely, you can use this tactic to block enemies from escaping, giving you the upper hand in combat.\nDealing with the Immolator Enemies Immolators are dangerous enemies that should be handled with caution. Unlike other enemies, they do not explode upon death. Instead, you can use blunt damage attacks like rifle butts or sledgehammers to defeat them. Be warned that striking them will cause them to burst into flames, so make sure you are prepared to deal with the aftermath.\nThe Perfect Timing for Killing Marion Tanks In order to kill Marion Tanks efficiently, timing is crucial. The most effective combination of attacks with the melee weapons known as the dusters is heavy, heavy, light, and heavy. This sequence of attacks ensures maximum damage output while staggering the enemy. Waiting a moment between the second heavy attack can also prevent the enemy from retaliating.\nThe Power of Charging with the Immolator As mentioned earlier, charging with the Immolator is a devastating tactic. It allows you to kill enemies in a single hit, making it an effective strategy when battling tough opponents.\nThe Reduced Damage on Teammates Friendly fire is an important aspect to consider in team-based games like Hunt Showdown. While you can still kill your teammates, the damage inflicted on them is reduced compared to enemy hunters. However, this does not apply to explosives, so be careful when using explosive weapons or traps around your teammates.\nThe Danger of Explosive Damage on Teammates Explosives such as dynamite and explosive crossbows do not have the reduced team damage feature. This means that your teammates can be harmed or even killed by these explosive weapons. Exercise caution when using them in situations where your teammates are nearby.\nRecognizing Different Hitboxes on Hunters Hunters in Hunt Showdown have five different hitboxes: legs, arms, torso, head, and the upper tonsil. Each of these hitboxes has different damage multipliers applied to them. Understanding the hitboxes and their associated multipliers can help you determine the most effective points to aim for when engaging in combat.\nUnderstanding the Map Size Both maps in Hunt Showdown have a size of one kilometer by one kilometer. This information is important to know when planning your movement and positioning on the map. Additionally, this knowledge can help you avoid getting detected by enemy players near the boundary carriers.\nThe Impact of Gunshots on the Map Gunshots in Hunt Showdown can give away your position to other players. It is important to remember that every gunshot from non-silenced weapons can be heard across the entire map. Even silenced weapons, such as the Dolch, can still be heard by nearby players. Only shoot your weapon if absolutely necessary or if you want to attract other players.\nUnderstanding What the Devil’s Cost Is The Devil’s Cost is a mechanic in Hunt Showdown where certain doors in a compound are guarded by devilish creatures. These creatures will attack players who try to open the doors, making them a formidable obstacle. However, you only need to kill one of these creatures to open a safe passage. The other creatures will despawn once you get close to the door. Be aware that the time window to kill the creatures and open the door is short, as the creatures may respawn quickly.\nKilling Ducks Efficiently Ducks can be a nuisance in Hunt Showdown, but they can be killed without using buckshots. Simply throwing a lantern at one of the ducks will cause the entire flock to die. This is a handy tip to remember when dealing with these pesky creatures.\nChecking Ammo Boxes and Med Kits Ammo boxes and med kits are valuable resources in Hunt Showdown. By checking these boxes, you can determine if they have been used by other players. An half-open box means that someone has used it once, while a completely open and empty box indicates that it has been used twice. Similarly, med kits contain two medical supply sets. If one set is used, the med kit will appear half-open. If both sets are used, the med kit will be completely empty and closed.\nUnderstanding Bear Traps and Wire Traps Bear traps and wire traps can be combined to create an effective trap for enemies. You can place two bear traps into one tripwire trap. However, keep in mind that you must place the tripwire trap first, as it cannot be placed over bear traps. This combination of traps can catch unsuspecting enemies and give you the element of surprise in combat.\nThe Effect of Bullet Damage Drop Different weapons in Hunt Showdown have varying amounts of bullet damage drop. This means that the further away your target is, the more power your shot will lose. For example, a crossbow bolt will experience a significant drop in power over a long distance. It is important to be aware of this mechanic when engaging enemies at different ranges.\nConsidering Bullet Travel Time In Hunt Showdown, bullets do not instantly hit their targets. Instead, they have travel time, similar to a projectile. When you pull the trigger, the game creates an object that travels towards your target based on the velocity of the bullet. This means that you must lead your shots accordingly, especially when shooting at moving targets.\nRecognizing Boss Aggro Bosses in Hunt Showdown can become more aggressive if you get too close to them or make too much noise in their vicinity. They will enter an enraged state and become more active, making them more difficult to defeat. If you encounter a boss in this state, be cautious, as other players may have triggered its aggression before you. They may still be nearby, posing a threat to your mission.\nHealing While Poisoned If you are poisoned in Hunt Showdown, you cannot use any healing items. However, if you successfully banish the boss, you will automatically be healed to full health, even while still poisoned. Keep this in mind when deciding whether to take on the boss or prioritize healing.\nThe Impact of Aim Punch Aim punch is a mechanic in Hunt Showdown that simulates the impact of a shot on your character. When you get hit by an enemy’s shot, your aim will move upwards, potentially throwing off your aim. This can be a frustrating experience, especially if you were about to make a crucial shot. It is important to be aware of aim punch and adjust your tactics accordingly.\nFlash Point Damage The flash bomb in Hunt Showdown effectively deals one point of damage to enemies. You do not need to directly hit your target with the flash bomb to inflict damage. As long as the enemy is within the blast radius, they will suffer one point of damage. This can be a useful tool when playing with the Sparks, a weapon with high damage output.\nConclusion In conclusion, these 100 tips and tricks will help you improve your skills in Hunt Showdown. From clever spawn tactics to utilizing various weapons and strategies, there is a wealth of knowledge to be gained. Make sure to apply these tips in your gameplay and practice them regularly to become a formidable hunter.

By dealing with them strategically, you can gain an advantage in combat.</p><h2 id=opening-doors-quietly>Opening Doors Quietly<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#opening-doors-quietly>#</a></h2><p>If you want to open doors quietly, crouching while opening them will minimize noise. This can be a smart move when you don&rsquo;t want to alert nearby enemies to your presence. However, keep in mind that opening doors while crouching is slower.</p><h2 id=quick-reloads-with-certain-weapons>Quick Reloads with Certain Weapons<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#quick-reloads-with-certain-weapons>#</a></h2><p>Some weapons, such as the Mosin, the Dolch, and the Bornheim, allow for quick reloads using stripper clips. This technique can save you time and potentially turn the tide of a battle. However, be cautious about reloading with only one bullet left, as your hunter will perform a stripper clip reload animation. It is advisable to reload bullet for bullet unless your weapon is completely empty.</p><h2 id=understanding-the-mechanics-of-hunters>Understanding the Mechanics of Hunters<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-the-mechanics-of-hunters>#</a></h2><p>Hunters in Hunt Showdown have different hitboxes, including legs, arms, torso, and head. Depending on which body part you hit, different multipliers will be applied to your damage. Understanding these hitboxes can help you optimize your shots and increase your chances of eliminating enemies efficiently.</p><h2 id=dropping-metal-gates>Dropping Metal Gates<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dropping-metal-gates>#</a></h2><p>Metal gates can be dropped by taking a single point of damage to them. This technique can be useful in both offensive and defensive strategies. If you are running away from enemies, you can run through these gates and then drop them to gain extra time to retreat. Conversely, you can use this tactic to block enemies from escaping, giving you the upper hand in combat.</p><h2 id=dealing-with-the-immolator-enemies>Dealing with the Immolator Enemies<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dealing-with-the-immolator-enemies>#</a></h2><p>Immolators are dangerous enemies that should be handled with caution. Unlike other enemies, they do not explode upon death. Instead, you can use blunt damage attacks like rifle butts or sledgehammers to defeat them. Be warned that striking them will cause them to burst into flames, so make sure you are prepared to deal with the aftermath.</p><h2 id=the-perfect-timing-for-killing-marion-tanks>The Perfect Timing for Killing Marion Tanks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-perfect-timing-for-killing-marion-tanks>#</a></h2><p>In order to kill Marion Tanks efficiently, timing is crucial. The most effective combination of attacks with the melee weapons known as the dusters is heavy, heavy, light, and heavy. This sequence of attacks ensures maximum damage output while staggering the enemy. Waiting a moment between the second heavy attack can also prevent the enemy from retaliating.</p><h2 id=the-power-of-charging-with-the-immolator>The Power of Charging with the Immolator<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-power-of-charging-with-the-immolator>#</a></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, charging with the Immolator is a devastating tactic. It allows you to kill enemies in a single hit, making it an effective strategy when battling tough opponents.</p><h2 id=the-reduced-damage-on-teammates>The Reduced Damage on Teammates<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-reduced-damage-on-teammates>#</a></h2><p>Friendly fire is an important aspect to consider in team-based games like Hunt Showdown. While you can still kill your teammates, the damage inflicted on them is reduced compared to enemy hunters. However, this does not apply to explosives, so be careful when using explosive weapons or traps around your teammates.</p><h2 id=the-danger-of-explosive-damage-on-teammates>The Danger of Explosive Damage on Teammates<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-danger-of-explosive-damage-on-teammates>#</a></h2><p>Explosives such as dynamite and explosive crossbows do not have the reduced team damage feature. This means that your teammates can be harmed or even killed by these explosive weapons. Exercise caution when using them in situations where your teammates are nearby.</p><h2 id=recognizing-different-hitboxes-on-hunters>Recognizing Different Hitboxes on Hunters<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#recognizing-different-hitboxes-on-hunters>#</a></h2><p>Hunters in Hunt Showdown have five different hitboxes: legs, arms, torso, head, and the upper tonsil. Each of these hitboxes has different damage multipliers applied to them. Understanding the hitboxes and their associated multipliers can help you determine the most effective points to aim for when engaging in combat.</p><h2 id=understanding-the-map-size>Understanding the Map Size<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-the-map-size>#</a></h2><p>Both maps in Hunt Showdown have a size of one kilometer by one kilometer. This information is important to know when planning your movement and positioning on the map. Additionally, this knowledge can help you avoid getting detected by enemy players near the boundary carriers.</p><h2 id=the-impact-of-gunshots-on-the-map>The Impact of Gunshots on the Map<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-impact-of-gunshots-on-the-map>#</a></h2><p>Gunshots in Hunt Showdown can give away your position to other players. It is important to remember that every gunshot from non-silenced weapons can be heard across the entire map. Even silenced weapons, such as the Dolch, can still be heard by nearby players. Only shoot your weapon if absolutely necessary or if you want to attract other players.</p><h2 id=understanding-what-the-devils-cost-is>Understanding What the Devil&rsquo;s Cost Is<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-what-the-devils-cost-is>#</a></h2><p>The Devil&rsquo;s Cost is a mechanic in Hunt Showdown where certain doors in a compound are guarded by devilish creatures. These creatures will attack players who try to open the doors, making them a formidable obstacle. However, you only need to kill one of these creatures to open a safe passage. The other creatures will despawn once you get close to the door. Be aware that the time window to kill the creatures and open the door is short, as the creatures may respawn quickly.</p><h2 id=killing-ducks-efficiently>Killing Ducks Efficiently<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#killing-ducks-efficiently>#</a></h2><p>Ducks can be a nuisance in Hunt Showdown, but they can be killed without using buckshots. Simply throwing a lantern at one of the ducks will cause the entire flock to die. This is a handy tip to remember when dealing with these pesky creatures.</p><h2 id=checking-ammo-boxes-and-med-kits>Checking Ammo Boxes and Med Kits<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#checking-ammo-boxes-and-med-kits>#</a></h2><p>Ammo boxes and med kits are valuable resources in Hunt Showdown. By checking these boxes, you can determine if they have been used by other players. An half-open box means that someone has used it once, while a completely open and empty box indicates that it has been used twice. Similarly, med kits contain two medical supply sets. If one set is used, the med kit will appear half-open. If both sets are used, the med kit will be completely empty and closed.</p><h2 id=understanding-bear-traps-and-wire-traps>Understanding Bear Traps and Wire Traps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-bear-traps-and-wire-traps>#</a></h2><p>Bear traps and wire traps can be combined to create an effective trap for enemies. You can place two bear traps into one tripwire trap. However, keep in mind that you must place the tripwire trap first, as it cannot be placed over bear traps. This combination of traps can catch unsuspecting enemies and give you the element of surprise in combat.</p><h2 id=the-effect-of-bullet-damage-drop>The Effect of Bullet Damage Drop<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-effect-of-bullet-damage-drop>#</a></h2><p>Different weapons in Hunt Showdown have varying amounts of bullet damage drop. This means that the further away your target is, the more power your shot will lose. For example, a crossbow bolt will experience a significant drop in power over a long distance. It is important to be aware of this mechanic when engaging enemies at different ranges.</p><h2 id=considering-bullet-travel-time>Considering Bullet Travel Time<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#considering-bullet-travel-time>#</a></h2><p>In Hunt Showdown, bullets do not instantly hit their targets. Instead, they have travel time, similar to a projectile. When you pull the trigger, the game creates an object that travels towards your target based on the velocity of the bullet. This means that you must lead your shots accordingly, especially when shooting at moving targets.</p><h2 id=recognizing-boss-aggro>Recognizing Boss Aggro<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#recognizing-boss-aggro>#</a></h2><p>Bosses in Hunt Showdown can become more aggressive if you get too close to them or make too much noise in their vicinity. They will enter an enraged state and become more active, making them more difficult to defeat. If you encounter a boss in this state, be cautious, as other players may have triggered its aggression before you. They may still be nearby, posing a threat to your mission.</p><h2 id=healing-while-poisoned>Healing While Poisoned<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#healing-while-poisoned>#</a></h2><p>If you are poisoned in Hunt Showdown, you cannot use any healing items. However, if you successfully banish the boss, you will automatically be healed to full health, even while still poisoned. Keep this in mind when deciding whether to take on the boss or prioritize healing.</p><h2 id=the-impact-of-aim-punch>The Impact of Aim Punch<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-impact-of-aim-punch>#</a></h2><p>Aim punch is a mechanic in Hunt Showdown that simulates the impact of a shot on your character. When you get hit by an enemy&rsquo;s shot, your aim will move upwards, potentially throwing off your aim. This can be a frustrating experience, especially if you were about to make a crucial shot. It is important to be aware of aim punch and adjust your tactics accordingly.</p><h2 id=flash-point-damage>Flash Point Damage<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#flash-point-damage>#</a></h2><p>The flash bomb in Hunt Showdown effectively deals one point of damage to enemies. You do not need to directly hit your target with the flash bomb to inflict damage. As long as the enemy is within the blast radius, they will suffer one point of damage. This can be a useful tool when playing with the Sparks, a weapon with high damage output.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>In conclusion, these 100 tips and tricks will help you improve your skills in Hunt Showdown. From clever spawn tactics to utilizing various weapons and strategies, there is a wealth of knowledge to be gained. Make sure to apply these tips in your gameplay and practice them regularly to become a formidable hunter.
