Thordan’s Reign is a new extreme primal encounter that was made available in Patch 3.1. This encounter can be quite challenging, but with the right strategy and coordination, you can emerge victorious. So let’s dive into the details and learn how to defeat Thordan the Wise.\nPhase 1: Dealing with Meteorologist Urkel’s Mechanics The first phase of the fight will last until Thordan reaches 70% health or completes his combo of mechanics. It is essential to handle each phase appropriately to reduce strain on healers and allow for high raid DPS. Thordan has a frontal cone attack that should be faced away from the raid. Throughout the encounter, Thordan will also cast Dragon’s Eye, a stacking buff that increases his outgoing damage. As the encounter progresses, each mechanic will hit harder, so it’s crucial for all players to do their best in handling them.\nThordan will begin by casting Meteorologist Urkel’s. Players should spread out in specific areas to avoid taking excessive damage. Next, Thordan will cast Ask Lance Mercy, a massive AOE pattern that players should dodge by moving between each slice or to the opposite side of the room. Getting hit by this attack can result in high damage and a guaranteed death.\nAfter that, Thordan will cast Dragon’s Eye, followed shortly by Dragon’s Gaze. Dragon’s Gaze will fear and place the vulnerability debuff on any player hit by it. To avoid Dragon’s Gaze, players must simply turn their characters away from Thordan. Another mechanic to watch out for is Lightning Storm, which players should spread out to avoid splashing damage on each other.\nLastly, Thordan will cast Heavenly Heal, a high-damage tank buster that should be mitigated and healed appropriately. It is crucial to manage your tank cooldowns and healing abilities during this phase.\nPhase 2: Raid Stacking and Dealing with Holy Chain and Heaven’s Flare Phase 2 begins with Thordan disappearing and a raid stacking in the center. Players will need to run to their pre-assigned areas at the eight cardinal points of the room. Thordan will cast Holy Chain and Heaven’s Flare simultaneously, and players must move away from each other to break the holy chains while dodging the AOEs from Heaven’s Flare. Additionally, Conviction towers will spawn, and players should stand in any towers near them to avoid explosions that can paralyze all players.\nAfter handling the Conviction towers, Sir Zephyr will begin to cast Sacred Cross in the center of the room. Players should focus on burning down Sir Zephyr as quickly as possible to minimize damage. Near the end of this cast, three Knights will spawn around the outer rim of the arena and cast Spiral Thrust, a dive bomb-like mechanic. Players should find safe zones marked on the ground to avoid deaths.\nPhase 3: Dealing with Sir Adele and Sir Jornel Phase 3 involves dealing with Sir Adele and Sir Jornel. Each tank should pick up one Knight and move them away from each other to prevent them from sharing their stances. Each Knight will begin by casting Divine Right, which determines their stance. The Sword stance makes the Knight deal and take more damage, while the Shield stance does the opposite. Damage dealers should focus on the Knight in Sword stance, while tanks handle the tank buster called Holy Blade Dance.\nDamage dealers will also need to deal with Skyward Leaps, which target certain players marked with a blue marker. These players should move away from the rest of the raid to minimize damage. Healers will have to deal with Holiest of Holy, a room-wide AOE damage that must be healed through.\nThese mechanics will repeat until each Knight is defeated.\nPhase 4: Raid Stacking and Dealing with Spiral Pierce and Charge Phase 4 begins with the raid stacking in the center again, ready to run to their pre-assigned spots. Three players will be tethered to Knights who will eventually cast Spiral Pierce and Charge in their direction. Other players will be affected by High Mole Storm, which will drop down Icicles. All players should wait for the Icicles to spawn beneath them before moving to their assigned spots. It is crucial to coordinate movements to avoid overlapping charges and cleaves.\nPhase 5: Dealing with Meteors and Thordan’s Ultimate Attack In Phase 5, players will need to deal with Thordan’s Eye casts, which will spawn a massive eyeball outside the arena. Players should avoid both Thordan and the eyeball during Dragon’s Gaze cast. A tank can position Thordan towards the outer edge, making it easier for players to focus on one direction. Additionally, an echo of Turn 10 will occur, involving healers being targeted by green markers and stunned by Holy Shield Bash.\nPhase 6: Repositioning and Handling Dragon’s Eye and Mechanics Phase 6 involves repositioning Thordan on the edge of the room and dealing with Dragon’s Eye casts. Players should spread out behind the boss, ready to handle the next set of mechanics. This phase combines mechanics from previous phases, requiring players to handle Dragon’s Gaze while searching for towers to step into and dodging Heavy Impact. Additionally, players should avoid Dimensional Collapse puddles and remain stacked to share damage from Dragon’s Rage.\nPhase 7: Spreading Out for Lightning Storm and Handling Mechanics In Phase 7, players should tank Thordan wherever, while the rest of the raid spreads out in preparation for Lightning Storm. Players should be aware of Knight spawns and their Spiral Thrust through the center of the room. Players will also be targeted for Charge, Blue for Skyward Leap, and Dragon’s Rage. Coordination is essential to handle these mechanics effectively.\nPhase 8: Dealing with Holy Chant, Holy Meteor, and Heavens Flame Phase 8 involves dealing with Holy Chant, Holy Meteor, and Heavens Flame mechanics. Players should fan out from the boss to break holy chains and dodge fireballs during Dragon’s Gaze. Additionally, players should be mindful of dimensional collapse puddles and avoid overlapping them. Healers should be cautious during this phase due to high stacks that increase damage.\nPhase 9: Burning the Boss and Handling AOE Damage The final phase involves burning down Thordan while dealing with holiest of holy and Heaven’s Ward leaps. Healers should be prepared for massive AOE damage. It is crucial to burn the boss as quickly as possible to minimize damage.\nConclusion Thordan’s Reign EXTREME PRIMAL encounter in Final Fantasy XIV is a challenging fight that requires coordination and strategy. By following the step-by-step process outlined in this guide and effectively handling each phase’s mechanics, you can emerge victorious. Good luck, and may you conquer Thordan the Wise!\n","wordCount":"1115","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Janet Labianca"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/thordans-reign-minstrels-ballad/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Thordan's Reign EXTREME PRIMAL Guide: Defeat Thordan the Wise in Final Fantasy XIV</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 17, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1115 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Janet Labianca</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#phase-1-dealing-with-meteorologist-urkels-mechanics>Phase 1: Dealing with Meteorologist Urkel&rsquo;s Mechanics</a></li><li><a href=#phase-2-raid-stacking-and-dealing-with-holy-chain-and-heavens-flare>Phase 2: Raid Stacking and Dealing with Holy Chain and Heaven&rsquo;s Flare</a></li><li><a href=#phase-3-dealing-with-sir-adele-and-sir-jornel>Phase 3: Dealing with Sir Adele and Sir Jornel</a></li><li><a href=#phase-4-raid-stacking-and-dealing-with-spiral-pierce-and-charge>Phase 4: Raid Stacking and Dealing with Spiral Pierce and Charge</a></li><li><a href=#phase-5-dealing-with-meteors-and-thordans-ultimate-attack>Phase 5: Dealing with Meteors and Thordan&rsquo;s Ultimate Attack</a></li><li><a href=#phase-6-repositioning-and-handling-dragons-eye-and-mechanics>Phase 6: Repositioning and Handling Dragon&rsquo;s Eye and Mechanics</a></li><li><a href=#phase-7-spreading-out-for-lightning-storm-and-handling-mechanics>Phase 7: Spreading Out for Lightning Storm and Handling Mechanics</a></li><li><a href=#phase-8-dealing-with-holy-chant-holy-meteor-and-heavens-flame>Phase 8: Dealing with Holy Chant, Holy Meteor, and Heavens Flame</a></li><li><a href=#phase-9-burning-the-boss-and-handling-aoe-damage>Phase 9: Burning the Boss and Handling AOE Damage</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-pZ5MfWpOTw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In this guide, we will be tackling the Thordan&rsquo;s Reign EXTREME PRIMAL encounter in Final Fantasy XIV.
