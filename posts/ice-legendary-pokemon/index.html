They are powerful, rare, and often have unique appearances and movesets. In the world of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, one such legendary Pokemon is Chien Pao. With its striking saber-toothed tiger style appearance and impressive moveset, capturing Chien Pao is a must for any Pokemon enthusiast. However, capturing Chien Pao requires removing all eight yellow stakes found around the map and venturing into its lair. In this guide, we will provide a super easy and efficient route to collecting all of the stakes one after another and successfully capturing Chien Pao.\nBefore we begin, make sure to have all of your Rider Powers unlocked, as some of the stake locations require climbing or gliding to reach. Now, let’s get started!\nStep 1: Starting Point - El For Nada Begin your journey in El For Nada, located in the western part of the map. This will serve as our starting point. From El For Nada, mark a point on your map near the cliffs by the river to the east. Run towards that location, and you’ll find the first yellow stake waiting for you at the edge of the nearby cliffs.\nStep 2: The Patch of Green The next yellow stake is situated on a little patch of green on the map, at the edge of the cliffs northwest of El For Nada. To reach this location, a combination of climbing and gliding will be required. Use your climbing and gliding abilities to reach the stake quickly and efficiently.\nStep 3: Into the Cave The third stake is located in an underground cave. To reach it, make your way to the cave entrance, which is lower down from the cliffs. Enter the cave, and you cannot miss the next yellow stake. Mark it on your map as you move forward.\nStep 4: Cliff Ledge Mark the fourth stake on your map, which is to the northwest of your current location. This stake is situated on a cliff ledge, requiring you to climb up to reach it. Exit the cave and start climbing towards the marked location. The stake should be easily found once you reach the top.\nStep 5: Circular Rock Platform The next stake is also in the northwest, but this time on a little circular rock platform. Make your way to this location, being careful not to fall down. Jump onto the rock without hesitation, and you’ll be able to grab the fifth yellow stake.\nStep 6: Farthest Stake The sixth stake is the farthest away yet, located in the northeast on a small patch of green under a towering mountain. This journey requires climbing and gliding, but with determination, you’ll find the stake in no time.\nStep 7: Cornered Stake Fortunately, the seventh stake is nearby, situated in a corner to the southeast. Run over to it, drop down the cliff, and claim it as your own.\nStep 8: Hidden Among Trees The eighth and final stake is hidden among the trees to the southeast of Kaskarafa. Teleport to the Pokemon Center and head towards the tree area. Keep your eyes open as you search behind one of the trees, and you’ll discover the stake.\nStep 9: Capturing Chien Pao Now that you have removed all eight yellow stakes, it’s time to face Chien Pao and capture this legendary Pokemon. The seal that leads to Chien Pao’s lair can be found near the cliff edge to the west of the West Province Area 1 Central Pokemon Center. Mark this location on your map, fly over there, and make your way to the seal.\nBefore engaging in battle, it is highly recommended to save your game. This precaution will prevent any unfortunate mishaps, such as accidentally defeating Chien Pao or encountering other challenges along the way. Additionally, ensure you have plenty of Ultra Balls or timer balls. It’s a lengthy battle, and running out of resources can be frustrating. We suggest reducing Chien Pao’s health to the red zone and applying a status effect such as sleep or paralysis to increase your chances of capturing it. Then, it’s all up to RNG (random number generation) and luck! Good luck on your quest to capture this incredible Sabretooth Pokemon.\nIf you manage to successfully capture Chien Pao, share your achievement in the comments below. Let us know the strategy you used and any other tips or experiences you’d like to share. Don’t forget to like and subscribe to our channel for more Pokemon guides. We have a wide range of content that can help you on your Pokemon journey.\nIn conclusion, the process of capturing Chien Pao involves removing all eight yellow stakes spread across the map and then facing the legendary Pokemon in its lair. By following the step-by-step guide provided here, you can efficiently collect all of the stakes and increase your chances of capturing Chien Pao. Remember to save your game before battling, bring plenty of resources, and apply status effects to improve your chances of success. Best of luck on your Pokemon Scarlet and Violet adventure!\n","wordCount":"851","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mae Edwards"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/ice-legendary-pokemon/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet - How to Capture Legendary Pokemon Chien Pao & Locate All 8 Yellow Stakes</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 10, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;851 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mae Edwards</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#step-1-starting-point---el-for-nada>Step 1: Starting Point - El For Nada</a></li><li><a href=#step-2-the-patch-of-green>Step 2: The Patch of Green</a></li><li><a href=#step-3-into-the-cave>Step 3: Into the Cave</a></li><li><a href=#step-4-cliff-ledge>Step 4: Cliff Ledge</a></li><li><a href=#step-5-circular-rock-platform>Step 5: Circular Rock Platform</a></li><li><a href=#step-6-farthest-stake>Step 6: Farthest Stake</a></li><li><a href=#step-7-cornered-stake>Step 7: Cornered Stake</a></li><li><a href=#step-8-hidden-among-trees>Step 8: Hidden Among Trees</a></li><li><a href=#step-9-capturing-chien-pao>Step 9: Capturing Chien Pao</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QCM-iH6zoKA style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Legendary Pokemon are a coveted part of any Pokemon trainer&rsquo;s collection.
