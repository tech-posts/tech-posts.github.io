According to the Steam charts, a trusted source for tracking game statistics, the average number of active players in the past month was as low as 4,100. This is a concerning figure, especially considering that it represents only Steam players and not those on consoles or other platforms.\nTo put this number into perspective, the last time ForHonor’s player count was this low was back in January 2018, which was considered a dark time for the game. In fact, the lowest player count ever recorded was in July 17th, with less than 2,000 active players. It is worth noting that these drops in player count can be expected to some extent as the game has been out for several years, and the excitement surrounding new releases tends to wane over time.\nTypically, when a new hero is introduced, player count tends to increase for a while. However, the current season of ForHonor has been notably dry in terms of new content and updates. While there have been a couple of reworks and a new skin, these additions alone have not been enough to maintain player engagement. The lack of significant changes or additions to the game has resulted in a decline in player interest and retention.\nIn July, there has been a slight improvement in player count, likely due to the summer season when more people tend to play video games. Additionally, ForHonor went on sale on Steam, attracting new players to the game. Historically, the game has experienced spikes in player count during the summer, with previous heroes like Magi, Kyoshin, and Warmonger attracting large numbers of players. These spikes, however, are not sustainable in the long term, and the game needs consistent content updates to retain its player base.\nIt has been observed that dry seasons, characterized by a lack of new content, have a negative impact on ForHonor’s player count. Players would rather endure balance issues with new heroes or reworks than have no new content to engage with. This highlights the importance of regular updates and additions to the game to keep players invested and interested.\nLooking ahead, the future of ForHonor remains uncertain. One crucial factor that could potentially turn the tide for the game is the upcoming release of the Aztec hero. If Ubisoft can deliver an engaging and well-designed hero, it could spark renewed interest and possibly attract more players, potentially reaching the coveted 10,000 player mark once again.\nIn conclusion, ForHonor’s player count has seen a decline in recent months, with the numbers reaching an all-time low. The lack of significant updates and content additions has contributed to this decline, and the game needs to address this issue to maintain its player base. The upcoming Aztec hero release could be a make-or-break moment for ForHonor, and all eyes will be on Ubisoft to see if they can deliver a game-changing update. Only time will tell if ForHonor can regain its former glory and overcome the challenges it currently faces.\nWe would love to hear your opinion on the future of ForHonor. Do you think the game can bounce back? Share your thoughts in the comments below, and let’s discuss the future of this beloved game.\nKey Points:\nForHonor’s player count has reached an all-time low, with only 4,100 average active players in the past month (Steam only). The game experienced its lowest player count back in January 2018 and recorded less than 2,000 active players on July 17th. Dry seasons with limited new content negatively impact ForHonor’s player count and retention. Summer tends to bring spikes in player count, but these are temporary and not sustainable in the long term. The upcoming release of the Aztec hero could potentially revive interest in the game and attract more players. Regular updates and content additions are crucial to maintain player engagement and interest in ForHonor.
