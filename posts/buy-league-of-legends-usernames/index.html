With its extensive roster of champions and unique gameplay, it has become a must-play for gamers of all skill levels. But what if you could buy a League of Legends account on eBay that already has a large number of champions and skins? Would it be worth it? In this article, we will delve into the world of buying League of Legends usernames and explore the pros and cons of purchasing accounts from third-party resellers.\nIntroduction: The Temptation of eBay Accounts eBay, a well-known online marketplace, offers an array of products and services, including League of Legends accounts. These accounts are advertised as having a wide variety of champions and skins, often at unbelievable low prices. But are these deals too good to be true?\nIn this article, we will follow the journey of a League of Legends player who purchased two eBay accounts, each priced at $50. The first account boasted 117 champions and 74 skins, while the second account claimed to have 125 champions and 91 skins. Our player, a Challenger-level player who goes by the name Pants are Dragon, was curious to see if these bargain accounts were legitimate or if they were simply scams.\nThe Warnings: Sketchy Product Descriptions As our player examined the product listings, he noticed some red flags. The account sellers had misspelled words and mentioned that the email and password of the accounts couldn’t be changed. This immediately raised suspicions about the legitimacy of the accounts. Additionally, the seller stated that the email associated with the account was lost, making it impossible to recover the account in case of any issues. Despite these warning signs, our player decided to take the risk of purchasing the accounts to see what would unfold.\nAccount 1: The Bronze Account The first account our player purchased had 117 champions and 74 skins. After logging into the account, our player explored the champion roster to see what champions were included. The account had an impressive collection of champions, with only a few newer champions missing. Considering the cost of purchasing each champion individually, this account seemed like a solid investment.\nNext, our player examined the skin collection. While some of the skins were lackluster, such as the basic 520 RP skins, there were a few gems, including a rare Pulsefire Ezreal skin that was worth around $30. Overall, considering the number of champions and skins included, our player believed that this account could be valued at around $1,000, taking into account playtime and the amount of money that the previous owner had spent.\nAccount 2: The Bronze Account with Missing Champions The second account our player purchased claimed to have 125 champions and 91 skins. Upon logging in, our player discovered that the account was indeed missing a few champions. However, this was to be expected, as the game has over 150 champions. Even with the missing champions, this account still offered a substantial roster for any player.\nAs for the skin collection, this account seemed to have a more impressive range of skins compared to the first account. Our player estimated that the value of this account, including playtime and previous spending, could be around $600. Of course, this estimation did not take into account the potential risks associated with buying accounts from third-party sellers.\nThe Verdict: Worth the Risk? While the accounts our player purchased seemed to offer great value for the price, it is important to consider the risks involved in buying League of Legends accounts from third-party resellers. These accounts can be vulnerable to scams and may result in potential loss or account recovery issues. Furthermore, transferring an account from one owner to another violates the game’s Terms of Service.\nPurchasing an account also eliminates the experience of building up your own collection of champions and skins. Many players find joy in earning rewards and unlocking new content through their own efforts. Additionally, buying an account may result in a mismatched skill level, leading to a frustrating gaming experience for both the player and their teammates.\nConclusion: Proceed with Caution In conclusion, while buying League of Legends accounts from eBay may seem like a tempting proposition, it is crucial to proceed with caution. The accounts may offer a wide array of champions and skins at a fraction of their actual value, but the risks involved in purchasing these accounts are significant. From potential scams to account recovery issues, it is often best to play the game as intended, building up your collection over time.\nIf you decide to proceed with purchasing an account, make sure to thoroughly research the seller and read reviews from previous buyers. Understanding the risks involved will help you make an informed decision. However, it is worth noting that buying an account violates the Terms of Service of the game, and there is a chance of losing your account altogether.\nRemember, the thrill of League of Legends comes from the sense of accomplishment and growth as you develop your skills and unlock new champions and skins through your own efforts. So, proceed with caution and enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played.\n","wordCount":"873","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Janie Rosado"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/buy-league-of-legends-usernames/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>**Buying League of Legends Usernames: Are eBay Accounts Worth It?**</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 27, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;873 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Janie Rosado</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction-the-temptation-of-ebay-accounts><strong>Introduction: The Temptation of eBay Accounts</strong></a></li><li><a href=#the-warnings-sketchy-product-descriptions><strong>The Warnings: Sketchy Product Descriptions</strong></a></li><li><a href=#account-1-the-bronze-account><strong>Account 1: The Bronze Account</strong></a></li><li><a href=#account-2-the-bronze-account-with-missing-champions><strong>Account 2: The Bronze Account with Missing Champions</strong></a></li><li><a href=#the-verdict-worth-the-risk><strong>The Verdict: Worth the Risk?</strong></a></li><li><a href=#conclusion-proceed-with-caution><strong>Conclusion: Proceed with Caution</strong></a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZXyjbddqwE style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>League of Legends is a popular online multiplayer game that has captivated millions of players worldwide.
