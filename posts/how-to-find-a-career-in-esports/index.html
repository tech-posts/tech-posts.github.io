Do you want to turn your passion for gaming into a profession? In this article, we will explore how to start a career in esports and the steps you can take to achieve your goals. From personal experiences to industry insights, we will provide valuable information on how to break into the world of professional gaming.\nFinding Your Path in Esports Earning a living through gaming might seem like a dream come true, but it requires dedication, skill, and a strategic approach. Here are some key points to consider when starting your journey to becoming a professional gamer:\n1. Finding Your Game First and foremost, you need to identify the game you want to specialize in. Whether it’s League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Fortnite, or any other popular esport, choose a game that you are truly passionate about and willing to invest time and effort into mastering.\n2. Building Your Skills Once you have found your game, it’s time to focus on improving your skills. Dedicate time to practice, learn the mechanics, and understand the strategies involved in the game. Watch tutorial videos, study professional players, and participate in online communities to gain knowledge and insights.\n3. Networking and Joining a Team In the esports industry, networking is crucial for success. Connect with like-minded gamers through online communities, forums, and social media platforms. Look for opportunities to join a team or participate in tournaments. Building relationships within the industry can open doors to potential job opportunities.\n4. Pursuing Education and Professionalism While esports is often associated with a laid-back and casual environment, professionalism is highly valued in the industry. Consider pursuing a degree in a related field, such as computer science or game design, to gain a deeper understanding of the industry and improve your chances of securing a job.\n5. Exploring Various Roles Not everyone will become a professional player, and that’s okay. Esports offers a wide range of career opportunities beyond gaming. Explore roles such as team manager, coach, analyst, commentator, content creator, and event organizer. Identify your strengths and interests to find a suitable role within the industry.\nA Personal Journey in Esports Now, let’s dive into the personal journey of Stanz, who shares his own experience in esports and how he found his way into the industry.\nStanz’s esports story began as a lifelong gamer. After participating in various tournaments and achieving high ranks in games like Starcraft and League of Legends, he aspired to become a professional player. Stanz’s dream took a turn when the IPL, one of the most prestigious League of Legends tournaments, was canceled. This setback led him to reevaluate his career goals and consider alternative paths in esports.\nStanz’s determination and networking skills paid off when he cold-emailed several esports professionals, including Steve Aronson, co-owner and co-CEO of Team Liquid. This led to a job opportunity as an account manager at Team Curse, which eventually led to him becoming the director of esports at Curse. Stanz’s role involved managing teams, bringing in top players, and overseeing esports operations.\nAfter Curse, Stanz joined Curse Media, where he gained valuable experience in the business side of esports. He helped sales teams sell ads on various esports websites and learned about the intricacies of running an esports organization.\nStanz’s journey continued as he joined Patreon as the Head of Gaming, where he worked to support creators in the gaming industry. He helped launch successful Patreon campaigns for well-known creators like JP and Danny O’Dwyer. Stanz’s time at Patreon expanded his expertise in the crowdfunding and digital content creation space.\nSubsequently, Stanz explored opportunities at GMR Marketing and Genji, further expanding his experience in partnerships and sales. At Genji, he played a key role in managing sponsorships and developing relationships with companies like Razor and Netgear.\nConclusion Starting a career in esports requires passion, dedication, and a strategic approach. By identifying your game, improving your skills, networking within the industry, and pursuing various roles, you can pave your own path towards success. Stanz’s personal journey exemplifies the possibilities and opportunities that exist within the esports industry. With the right mindset and determination, you can turn your passion into a fulfilling career in esports.\n","wordCount":"720","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sherry Lowe"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/how-to-find-a-career-in-esports/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Find a Career in Esports: A Path to Success</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;720 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sherry Lowe</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#finding-your-path-in-esports>Finding Your Path in Esports</a><ul><li><a href=#1-finding-your-game>1.
