However, there are instances where users may find themselves banned from the website, preventing them from accessing and purchasing their favorite Pokémon TCG products. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind these bans and provide useful tips on how to address the situation and avoid future bans.\nWhy Use the Pokémon Center Website? The Pokémon Center website is a legitimate source for purchasing Pokémon TCG products. It offers a straightforward purchasing experience, eliminating the involvement of third parties and the risk of tampering or resealing of items. By buying directly from the Pokémon Center, customers can ensure the authenticity and quality of their purchases.\nThe Limitation of Sales on PokémonCenter.com While the Pokémon Center website guarantees the authenticity of its products, it does not frequently offer sales or discounts. Most items are priced at their manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) and remain at that price indefinitely. Sales are typically limited to clearance items, which may be offered at a reduced price for a limited time before selling out.\nWhy Users Get Banned from the Pokémon Center Website Users often get banned from the Pokémon Center website when they exhibit suspicious browsing behavior, particularly during the release of highly sought-after products. In response to scalpers and bot activity, the Pokémon Center team activates their robot detection software. This software identifies and flags users who display behavior similar to that of automated bots.\nBots are advantageous to scalpers as they can quickly add multiple items to the cart and complete transactions at a much faster rate than a human would be capable of doing. However, the Pokémon Center has implemented measures to combat this unfair advantage by temporarily banning users who engage in bot-like behavior.\nUnderstanding the Banning Process When a user’s browsing activity triggers the robot detection software, they will receive a warning indicating that their browsing history appears suspicious. This warning serves as an opportunity for the user to prove their identity and confirm that they are not a bot. However, continuous suspicious activity may result in temporary bans from accessing the Pokémon Center website.\nThe temporary ban is not permanent and usually lasts approximately 24 hours. During this time, the user’s IP address is flagged, preventing access to the website. However, after the ban is lifted, the user can resume browsing and purchasing from the Pokémon Center without any restrictions.\nHow to Deal with a Pokémon Center Website Ban If you find yourself banned from the Pokémon Center website, there are a few steps you can take to address the situation:\nWait it out: The ban is only temporary, lasting around 24 hours. This ban gives the Pokémon Center team enough time to assess the situation and prevent further bot activity.\nEnsure your IP address is not shared: If you share your IP address with others on the same network, they could inadvertently trigger the robot detection software and potentially lead to your ban. Communicate with others using the same network to avoid similar browsing behavior and potential bans.\nUse a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help bypass the temporary ban by changing your IP address. By connecting to a different server using a VPN, you can access the Pokémon Center website without triggering the robot detection software. Additionally, some VPNs dynamically assign IP addresses, further reducing the chances of getting flagged.\nPractice internet hygiene: Avoid engaging in behavior that may resemble bot activity, such as repeatedly clicking on items or attempting to add multiple items to your cart simultaneously. By browsing and purchasing items at a natural pace, you can reduce the risk of being flagged.\nConclusion Getting banned from the Pokémon Center website can be frustrating for Pokémon TCG enthusiasts. However, it’s essential to understand that these bans are temporary and can be avoided by practicing a natural browsing behavior. By following the tips mentioned in this article, you can continue to enjoy the benefits of shopping from the Pokémon Center website without interruptions.
