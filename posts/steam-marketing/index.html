We will explore the steps necessary to climb the marketing ladder on Steam and eventually reach the front page. By understanding the process and implementing the right techniques, you can increase your game’s exposure and ultimately make money on Steam.\nInitial Attention: The First Spark Every game starts with zero wish lists on Steam. To gain visibility and capture the attention of potential players, you need to create an initial spark. This initial attention is crucial to kickstart the visibility of your game. Some games possess what Chris Zukowski, a renowned gaming expert, calls “the magic.” These games have that undefinable quality that draws people in and makes them want to try the game. They stand out from the rest.\nThere are six possible ways to earn this magic:\nIncredibly beautiful graphics: Games that feature visually stunning graphics can captivate players from the moment they see a screenshot. These graphics can be unique and mind-blowing, creating a sense of intrigue and curiosity. High concept game: Games with innovative or unusual concepts can generate immediate interest. When players learn about the game’s unique mechanics or story, they feel compelled to give it a try. Hilarious sandbox game: Some games thrive on absurdity and randomness. These games allow players to create humorous scenarios and witness unexpected outcomes. The ability to generate funny GIFs or moments can attract a lot of attention. Amazing addicting gameplay: Games that offer addictive and engaging gameplay can quickly gain popularity. When players immerse themselves in a game and lose track of time, they become loyal fans and advocate for the game. Infinitely deep game: Games that provide players with endless possibilities, complex systems, and deep gameplay mechanics can keep players hooked for hours on end. These games offer depth and longevity, appealing to hardcore gamers. Underserved audience: Sometimes, games that cater to specific niches or underserved communities find success. These games tap into the desires and interests of a particular group of players, who appreciate having a game tailored to their preferences. It’s important to note that games with the magic can fall into two categories:\n“Seeing is believing”: Games that immediately grab players’ attention with a single screenshot or tweet. The visuals or concept are so intriguing that players feel compelled to try the game. “Playing is believing”: Games that may not make a strong impression at first glance but become incredibly fun and addictive once players start playing. These games may not have impressive visuals or concepts, but the gameplay is so enjoyable that players can’t put it down. To create a viral buzz around your game, utilizing social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, and trailers can be effective. Remember, you can’t fake the magic. If your game has the spark, genuine promotion and word-of-mouth will take care of the rest.\nThe Marketing Ladder Steps Now that we understand the importance of initial attention, let’s dive into the steps required to climb the marketing ladder on Steam. These steps will gradually increase the visibility of your game, leading to featured placement and, eventually, substantial revenue.\n1. Initial Attention: At this stage, you focus on generating the initial spark, as discussed earlier. This involves showcasing the unique aspects of your game, whether it’s the stunning graphics, innovative concept, hilarious sandbox elements, addictive gameplay, depth, or catering to an underserved audience.\n2. Continued Growth: After gaining some initial attention, it’s time to maintain momentum. Consistent updates, engaging with the community, creating informative content, and building anticipation can help sustain interest in your game.\n3. Curated Exposure: To increase exposure, you can collaborate with influencers, streamers, and content creators in the gaming industry. By allowing them to experience your game and share their thoughts with their audiences, you can reach a wider demographic and attract more players.\n4. Steam Featuring: This is a significant milestone on the marketing ladder. To get featured on Steam, you need to accumulate a significant number of wish lists—typically around 100,000—before the festival event. Games that achieve this feat can generate massive exposure and attention.\n5. Launch: When you’re ready to launch your game, leverage your accumulated wish lists and engage in a strategic marketing campaign. This will create excitement and encourage players to purchase your game during its release period.\n6. Steam Curation: Finally, reaching the top of the marketing ladder involves making a substantial amount of money through your game. Steam curators, who have a loyal following and influence on the platform, can help promote your game and boost its sales.\nIt’s important to note that each step requires dedicated effort, continuous improvement, and adaptation to the ever-evolving gaming landscape. By following these steps and understanding the intricacies of the marketing ladder, you can increase your chances of success on Steam.\nConclusion In conclusion, marketing your game on Steam requires a systematic approach and an understanding of the steps involved in climbing the marketing ladder. By creating initial attention, nurturing growth, seeking curated exposure, aiming for Steam featuring, launching strategically, and ultimately achieving Steam curation, you can maximize the visibility and revenue potential of your game. Remember, the magic lies in the unique aspects and appeal of your game. Implementing effective marketing strategies and leveraging social media platforms can propel your game to great heights. So, embark on this journey armed with knowledge, passion, and a commitment to delivering an exceptional gaming experience. Good luck on your quest to conquer the marketing ladder on Steam!\n","wordCount":"931","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kristin Holland"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/steam-marketing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>**The Marketing Ladder on Steam: A Step-by-Step Guide to Success**</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 24, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;931 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kristin Holland</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#initial-attention-the-first-spark>Initial Attention: The First Spark</a></li><li><a href=#the-marketing-ladder-steps>The Marketing Ladder Steps</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E656RcGWcEs style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In this article, we will discuss the marketing strategies used on Steam, a popular gaming platform, to achieve maximum visibility and success for your game.
