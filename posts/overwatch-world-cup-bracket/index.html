If you’re a fan looking for a comprehensive guide to the Overwatch World Cup qualifiers, including important information about the participating teams, rewards, and more, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we’ll cover the basics, such as the start date, rules, brackets, and how to watch the qualifiers. We’ll also discuss the incentives for tuning into the streams and purchasing World Cup-themed skins. Furthermore, we’ll dive into the qualifiers themselves, exploring how they work, which teams will compete against each other, and how the teams will be selected for the group stage. Let’s jump right into it!\nBasics: Start Date, Rules, Brackets, and Viewing Options The World Cup qualifiers for all regions will begin on Thursday, June 22nd, and will run until July 2nd. The schedule might vary based on time zones, so it’s important to check the schedule to ensure you don’t miss your most anticipated matches. The Overwatch World Cup can be watched on either YouTube or Twitch, and co-streams by creators from both platforms will also be available. This is a unique opportunity for Twitch streamers who were previously unable to stream Overwatch content. By tuning into the streams, viewers can earn various rewards, including sprays, player icons, and World Cup-themed skins for Winston, Zenyatta, Hammond, and Moira. Some of these rewards can also be obtained by making purchases on Twitch.\nFor those who don’t have the time to watch the streams but still want to show their support and own World Cup gear, an APAC, EMEA, and Americas bundle is available for purchase. Additionally, there will be a legendary Ocean Goddess Siren skin available for purchase for those who prefer a different theme.\nQualifiers: How They Work and Which Teams Will Compete The Overwatch World Cup features a total of 40 countries across three regions: the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. The participating countries in each region will be divided into two groups. Each group will go through a round-robin format, and the top teams from each group will qualify for the group stage, which will be held later this fall. While each region boasts 12 or more teams, only five teams from each region will advance, totaling 15 spots for the World Cup at BlizzCon.\nChina automatically qualifies for the top 16, resulting in the math working out for the remaining spots. In the Americas region, the notable teams are Canada and the United States, both of which are placed in Group A. The match between these two teams is expected to be highly competitive, with the winner likely securing the highest seed from their group.\nIn Group B, the competition becomes more uncertain, with no clear favorite. The absence of a strong South American team makes it difficult to predict which teams will excel. However, Colombia, with the inclusion of EQO, a Philly Fusion legend, and Brazil, whose roster consists of retired South American contenders players, may prove to be strong contenders for advancing to the next stage.\nIn Europe and the Middle East region, the competition is fierce, with 16 countries vying for only five spots. In Group A, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and France are considered strong contenders. The UK boasts a number of British legends, while Denmark has an impressive DPS line-up comprising Shockwave, Naga, and Shax. France, despite not being as strong as in previous years, features current and former Overwatch League players like Poco, Benbest, FDGod, and Nico. The Netherlands, with coach Casores leading the team, has the potential to surprise with their well-coached players.\nGroup B in Europe and the Middle East consists of eight countries battling for two spots. Sweden, with their formidable DPS duo of Sp9rk1e and Kevster, is the team that fans are eagerly waiting to watch. However, competition from Finland, Germany, and other countries will make this group tightly contested.\nPredictions for Advancing Teams In the Americas region, it is expected that Canada and the United States will advance easily from Group A. Joining them in the group stage will likely be Mexico, given their decent competitive history and the guidance of former Overwatch League player Nomy, who is coaching the team. In Group B, Brazil and Colombia are predicted to advance. Brazil’s previous professional experience and the potential for EQO to carry Colombia make them likely candidates to move forward.\nIn Europe and the Middle East, Group A is set to be a four-team race between the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and France. With their strong rosters and experienced coaching staff, these teams have the highest chances of advancing to the group stage. In Group B, Sweden is the fan favorite, and their DPS duo is expected to dominate. However, competition from other strong teams like Finland and Germany will make it a challenging group to predict.\nConclusion The Overwatch World Cup qualifiers are set to be an intense and thrilling event, featuring highly competitive matches from teams around the world. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or a casual viewer, there are many reasons to tune in and support your favorite teams. From the excitement of watching the matches to earning rewards through stream engagement, the Overwatch World Cup offers something for everyone. So mark your calendars, choose your viewing platform, and get ready to cheer on your favorite teams as they battle for a spot at BlizzCon.\n","wordCount":"919","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-26T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-26T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Malin"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/overwatch-world-cup-bracket/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>A Fan's Guide to the Overwatch World Cup Qualifiers: Teams, Rewards, and More!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-26 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 26, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;919 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;William Malin</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#basics-start-date-rules-brackets-and-viewing-options>Basics: Start Date, Rules, Brackets, and Viewing Options</a></li><li><a href=#qualifiers-how-they-work-and-which-teams-will-compete>Qualifiers: How They Work and Which Teams Will Compete</a></li><li><a href=#predictions-for-advancing-teams>Predictions for Advancing Teams</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVtF7lb-nrw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>The Overwatch World Cup is back after a three-year hiatus, and it&rsquo;s gearing up to be an exciting event leading up to BlizzCon.
