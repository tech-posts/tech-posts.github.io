Although the premise of the game may seem a bit ahistorical, it is incredibly enjoyable to play. In this article, we will delve into the various aspects of For Honor in 2019, exploring its gameplay mechanics, customization options, character unlocking process, and overall improvements. We’ll also address the game’s strengths and weaknesses, and whether it is better than ever.\nGameplay mechanics and Controls\nOne of the main concerns for players is whether a controller is necessary to play For Honor or if a keyboard and mouse setup can suffice. While the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, there are certain aspects, such as reflex guard heroes, that may be easier to handle with a controller. Reflex guard heroes require players to constantly move their mouse in the direction of incoming attacks, which can be challenging. However, static guard heroes provide a more straightforward blocking mechanism as they continue to block attacks from the direction players last moved their mouse. Whether using a controller or a keyboard and mouse, players can enjoy the game and adapt their playstyle accordingly.\nCharacter Customization and Unlocking\nSimilar to games like Rainbow Six Siege, Dota, and Overwatch, For Honor features preset characters that cannot be customized to one’s liking. However, players can customize the gear of the characters they have unlocked by grinding matches. By unlocking better gear, such as armor, hilts, and helmets, players can enhance the abilities of their characters. Unwanted gear can also be dismantled for crafting materials, which can be used to upgrade desirable gear. It’s important to note that new characters need to be unlocked, either by purchasing a season pass or by spending in-game grind currency. This unlocking process helps maintain the game’s community while allowing players to support the developers.\nCharacter Unlocking Process\nThe character unlocking process in For Honor is relatively straightforward; however, the time required may vary depending on the edition of the game. The standard edition allows players to play with all 12 launch heroes, with only three of them being customizable initially. The other nine heroes can only be customized after spending 500 steel on each of them. The starter edition, on the other hand, allows players to play with six launch heroes, with only three being customizable at the start. To unlock customization for the remaining three heroes, players need to grind 8,000 steel on each of them. Both editions require players to spend 15,000 steel to unlock new heroes and 10,000 steel to unlock DLC heroes. Although the grind may seem daunting, players can accumulate steel by completing various in-game challenges.\nIn-Game Currency and Challenges\nFor Honor uses steel as its grind currency, which can be earned by completing matches and used to unlock characters. While players have the option to purchase steel with real money, the game provides plenty of opportunities to earn steel through contracts and daily orders. Contracts, which are replaced every 48 hours, offer 100 to 200 steel for completing challenges, such as capturing a designated number of zones or playing a certain number of matches in specific game modes. Daily orders offer even more steel for less effort and include tasks such as completing two matches of any kind, using two different heroes, and executing three heroes. By completing these challenges, players can accumulate steel without feeling the need to purchase it with real money.\nGrinding for Steel\nTo calculate the hourly rate of steel grinding, Ubisoft has stated that it takes 8 to 15 hours to grind 8,000 steel, depending on the player’s playstyle. Using these figures as a basis, it would take players with the standard edition approximately 169.5 to 318 hours to unlock customization for all heroes. Players with the starter edition can expect to spend 190 to 356.5 hours for the same task. It’s important to note that these calculations assume players with the starter edition unlock the hero bundle, which costs less steel than unlocking the heroes individually. While the grind may seem time-consuming, it is feasible to unlock customization for all heroes with dedication and perseverance.\nGame Presentation and Visuals\nFor Honor’s presentation and visuals are top-notch. The game immediately draws players in with its striking visuals and immersive audio design. The clash of steel and wood creates a realistic portrayal of medieval battle, enhanced by the exquisite textures and level of detail on the environment and character models. While the graphics are impressive, there is room for improvement, such as adding more detail to fire effects and implementing a bloom effect. However, these minor criticisms do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the game, as most players are focused on the intense combat rather than visual aesthetics.\nSound Design and Character Voice Lines\nThe sound design in For Honor is exceptional, especially during combat. Each move has its distinct audio cue, which can warn players of imminent danger. The character voice lines are particularly noteworthy, as they contribute to the immersive experience and add personality to the heroes. These voice lines also serve a practical purpose, as they indicate specific moves and allow players to anticipate and counter them. However, some players may find certain Chinese heroes’ voice lines repetitive or annoying after prolonged exposure.\nGameplay Mechanics and Animation\nFor Honor’s gameplay mechanics and animations are slick and smooth. Unlike other games in the same genre, For Honor avoids clunky and floaty movement, ensuring a more immersive and responsive gameplay experience. While some players argue that certain animations are unrealistic and exaggerated, it is important to remember that gameplay takes precedence over realism in this context. The focus is on fast reflexes and strategic deception, which contribute to the fast-paced and enjoyable combat.\nConnectivity Issues and Single-player Campaign\nOne of the drawbacks of For Honor is occasional connectivity issues, which can lead to disconnections from matches or difficulty accessing the main menu. While multiplayer connectivity issues are relatively common, it is inexcusable that players cannot start the single-player campaign without a persistent connection. Ubisoft should consider allowing players to access the single-player campaign offline, as this would provide a more seamless and enjoyable experience.\nSingle-player Campaign and Tutorials\nAlthough the single-player campaign may not be particularly memorable in terms of storytelling, it serves an important purpose. The campaign preserves old mechanics that have been removed from multiplayer matches and provides a time capsule of the game’s evolution. However, the campaign’s reliance on tutorials can be misleading, as they do not provide comprehensive information or highlight essential gameplay techniques. The lack of reliable tutorials is a drawback, as they fail to educate newer players effectively.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, For Honor in 2019 is better than ever. The game offers a unique and enjoyable combat experience set in a medieval world of Vikings, samurais, and Knights. With improved gameplay mechanics, extensive character customization options, and regular updates from the developers, For Honor has successfully maintained its player base and community. While there are still minor issues, such as connectivity problems and the need for better tutorials, these do not overshadow the game’s strengths. Overall, For Honor is a game that will captivate players with its intense combat, stunning visuals, and immersive audio design.\n","wordCount":"1224","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carolina Trosper"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/2019-does-for-honor-still-have-players/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>For Honor in 2019 - A Comprehensive Review and Analysis</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 16, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1224 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Carolina Trosper</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDfHPpM0_Rw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>For Honor, a third-person medieval hero fighter, takes place in an alternative history medieval setting where Viking samurais and Knights transcend time and geography to fight each other.
