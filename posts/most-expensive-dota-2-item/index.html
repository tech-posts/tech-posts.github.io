In today’s video, we will be delving into the realm of cosmetic items in DOTA 2 and uncovering the top 10 most expensive ones. These items, coveted by players and collectors alike, have obtained astronomical prices over the years. From legendary Dragon Claw Hooks to elusive Golden Baby Roshans, we will discover the stories behind these rare treasures and the reasons why they have become so valuable. So, sit back, relax, and let’s dive into the fascinating world of the most expensive DOTA 2 items.\nDragon Claw Hook: A Legendary Pudge Item\nLet us begin our journey with a legendary item that holds a special place in the hearts of Pudge players and fans alike. The Dragon Claw Hook transformed Pudge’s iconic ability, the hook, by adorning it with menacing bones. This unique cosmetic set it apart from other hooks in the game and became an instant hit among players. However, what makes this item truly rare is the fact that it could only be obtained during a limited-time event from July 12th to July 31st, 2012. As the game was still gaining popularity at that time, not many players were aware of the significance of the item. Some even sold the Dragon Claw Hook for a low price, only to regret it later. Today, this once affordable item commands a staggering price tag of at least $200.\nMonarch Bow: Owning a Piece of Dota History\nNot all items in Dota 2 can be acquired within the game itself. Some require players to purchase game merchandise, such as collectible figures, which come bundled with exclusive codes for rare items. One such item is the Monarch Bow, a mythical bow for Drow Ranger. This highly sought-after cosmetic could be obtained by purchasing a collectible figure produced by WETA Workshop, a renowned creator of detailed game figures. The figure itself, priced at $250, came with a code that granted access to the incredibly rare Monarch Bow in-game. As the figure is no longer available for purchase, the price of the Monarch Bow has skyrocketed to at least $300.\nShattered Greatsword: Rarity and Difficulty\nNext on our list is the Shattered Greatsword, a mythical sword for Sven. This exquisite weapon was not easy to obtain, as it could only be acquired from a chest released in 2015 by Nexon, the Korean company that collaborated with Valve to support Dota 2 in South Korea. Nexon aimed to attract new players to Dota 2 through this chest, which included the highly coveted Shattered Greatsword among its rewards. Today, this once elusive item carries a hefty price tag of at least $400.\nBracers of Aeons of the Crimson Witness: Witnessing History\nNow, let’s turn our attention to the Bracers of Aeons of the Crimson Witness, an immortal item for The Faceless Void. These stunning bracers, available in both default and red styles, were part of the immortal case released before TI7. However, acquiring the Crimson Witness version of these bracers required more than just luck or buying from the market. Players had to attend the tournament in Seattle, witness the first blood in the matches, and only then would they be rewarded with this valuable cosmetic. As a result, the price of these bracers starts from $400 on the community market.\nTsukumo the Moon Cloud: A Precious Mount\nIn the realm of cosmetic items, mounts hold a special allure for players. One such mount is Tsukumo the Moon Cloud, a favorite of the hero Mirana. Acquiring this magnificent mount was no easy feat, as it was once exclusively available to those who purchased a 1/16th scale sculpture of Mirana. Created by talented sculptors Mark Newman and Stanley Lau, this sculpture was sold exclusively on We Love Fine in 2017. With no more sculptures available for purchase, the Tsukumo the Moon Cloud mount quickly became a rare commodity, commanding a price of $500. What makes this item even more special is its two styles, allowing players to choose between riding a moon bunny or an ordinary blue tiger, both serving as majestic companions for Mirana.\nGolden Staff of Perplex: Unleashing the Magic\nRubick, the Grand Magus, is known for his mastery of magic. And what better way to channel his magical prowess than through the Golden Staff of Perplex. Released alongside other golden immortal modifications in 2015, this staff took Rubick’s first skill to new heights. While the regular Staff of Perplex can be obtained for around $13, the Golden Staff of Perplex starts at $500. With its shimmering golden hue, this item signifies Rubick’s ascendancy as the greatest magician in Dota 2.\nGolden Silent Wake: A Gilded Cape\nDrow Ranger, a formidable ranged hero in Dota 2, possesses a multitude of cosmetic items. However, one cape stands out from the rest: the Golden Silent Wake. Released in 2016 as part of the Immortals for Drow Ranger, the Golden Silent Wake transforms the hero’s gust ability into a stunning golden spectacle. With its unique design and eye-catching color scheme, the Golden Silent Wake surpasses its regular counterpart, which can be acquired for approximately $17, by leaps and bounds. If you seek to adorn your Drow Ranger with this captivating cape, be prepared to spend at least $600.\nNabel Mine: A Tidehunter Meme\nSometimes, the most intriguing stories come from unexpected places. This is true in the case of Nabel Mine, a skin for Tidehunter that has become a meme within the Dota 2 community. Rumors circulated among players that the Nabel Mine would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Ursa set, elevating its status from common to immortal. Players began hoarding the Nabel Mine, anticipating its rise in value. However, years went by, and Valve remained silent on the matter, leaving the item as it was. While the price briefly increased after TI-11, it eventually settled at around $2. So, if you’re considering purchasing some Nabel Mines for Tidehunter, think twice or perhaps consider supporting our channel financially through PayPal or Patreon!\nThe Alpine Stalker: From Uncommon to Immortal\nThe story of the Alpine Stalker, a set for Ursa, is an amusing one. Initially, this set could be purchased by any Dota 2 player who had just downloaded the game, albeit as an uncommon item. However, the designers later realized that a bear wearing a hat did not align with the game’s strict aesthetics and decided to change the status of all the set’s parts to immortal. But a few lucky players had already obtained the set, and it remained with them. Acquiring the complete set can be quite challenging, as it is often sold in parts. If you’re willing to invest in the full set, be prepared to spend around $1,000. However, if you’re on a budget, you can find the cursed Alpine Stalker, part of the set, on the community market for a staggering $1,700.\nGolden Baby Roshan: The Ultimate Rarity\nFinally, we come to the crème de la crème of DOTA 2 cosmetics, the Golden Baby Roshan. Baby Roshans in various colors have always held significant value in the Dota 2 community. However, the introduction of the 2019 Battle Pass brought about a change in the dynamic. During the duration of the compendium, owners were given shovels with which they could dig for Honey Heist baby Roshans. Previously, Golden Baby Roshans were incredibly rare and could only be obtained during the Diretide Halloween event in 2012. The scarcity of these golden variants, coupled with their stunning appearance, has made them highly coveted by collectors. Unfortunately, if you were hoping to add this gem to your collection, you won’t find it on the community market, and the asking price starts at a whopping $1,400.\nThe Most Expensive DOTA 2 Item: The Ordinary War Dog\nAt last, we arrive at our final item, the most expensive DOTA 2 item of all time – the Ordinary War Dog. With a staggering price tag of $38,000, this courier redefines rarity and exclusivity. The astronomical value of this item arose from a system error in which players were able to create a War Dog courier with a combination of gem colors that should not have been possible. Valve quickly rectified the error, removing this feature from the game. Thus, those lucky few who were able to obtain this extraordinary courier possess an item that stands as a testament to a bygone era. The pink hue and the unique appearance of this War Dog have solidified its status as the most expensive DOTA 2 item ever.\nConclusion\nAnd there you have it – a detailed exploration of the top 10 most expensive DOTA 2 items. From Dragon Claw Hooks to Golden Baby Roshans, these cosmetic treasures have captured the imaginations of players and collectors alike. Each item tells its own unique story, from limited-time events to system errors and exclusive promotions. The rarity and desirability of these items have driven their prices to unprecedented heights, making them truly coveted possessions. Whether you’re a DOTA 2 enthusiast or a connoisseur of fine gaming collectibles, these expensive items offer a glimpse into the extraordinary world of DOTA 2 cosmetics. So, if you’re looking to elevate your in-game presence or simply want to appreciate the artistry behind these items, dive into the realm of the most expensive DOTA 2 items and discover a world of luxury and rarity.\n","wordCount":"1576","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anita Bingham"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/most-expensive-dota-2-item/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>**The Most Expensive DOTA 2 Items: A Look at the Top 10 Overpriced Skins**</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 30, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1576 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Anita Bingham</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZnE7gSci6tg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em></p><p>Welcome to Good Game Republic, where we explore the world of DOTA 2 and all its fascinating intricacies.
