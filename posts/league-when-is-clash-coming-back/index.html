When you come back after a break, it can feel like you’ve missed out on a ton of new features and changes. In this article, we’ll highlight some of the most important things you need to know if you’re just returning to Clash of Clans. We’ll cover key updates, changes, and features that you should be aware of to catch up quickly and start enjoying the game again.\nKey Points: Introduction Returning to an Upgraded Village Changes to Spells Sceneries – Changing the Setting of Your Base Builder Base – Six Builders and Auto Hut Building Requirements for Town Hall Upgrades Super Troops and Super Potion Higher Frame Rate Option Troops Are Now 100% Free The Trader – Weekly Reset and Raid Medals Clan Capital and Clan Raids Pets – Assigning Pets to Heroes Magic Items – Books, Potions, and More Clan War Leagues and League Shop Practice Mode – Tutorials and Free Loot Siege Machines – Special Weapons for Attacking Step-by-Step Guide: 1. Returning to an Upgraded Village If you haven’t played Clash of Clans since 2021 or have been inactive for more than 90 days, your base will start upgrading itself. When you log back in, the Villager will update you on what the builders and wizards have been doing since you left. You’ll receive a village boost that lasts for a few days, which enhances various aspects of your gameplay.\n2. Changes to Spells Spells have undergone some reworks in recent years. For example, the Lightning Spell now takes up fewer housing spaces and functions like the zap spell in Clash Royale, hitting only one area once. Make sure to check if any spells you used to use have changed before brewing them.\n3. Sceneries – Changing the Setting of Your Base A new feature called sceneries was added in 2020, allowing you to change the setting of your base. Sceneries can transform your base into a jungle, mountain, or even resemble Clash Royale. You can obtain sceneries from the shop, challenges, or by reaching Town Hall 14 and 15. For returning players, older sceneries are also available for purchase in the shop.\n4. Builder Base – Six Builders and Auto Hut If you’re new to the Builder Base or haven’t fully explored it, you’ll discover that you can obtain a sixth builder by upgrading the auto hut. This building is obtained by completing various tasks, and all upgrades are free. You can switch the builder between the Builder Base and the home village depending on where you need it.\n5. Building Requirements for Town Hall Upgrades Previously, it was possible to upgrade a Town Hall without building all the associated buildings and walls. However, due to abuse in Clan Wars, there are now requirements in place. Make sure to build everything required before moving on to the next Town Hall level.\n6. Super Troops and Super Potion At Town Hall 11, you’ll notice a new building called the Super Troop, which trains super versions of regular troops. These troops take up more housing space and can be used with a super potion to activate their special abilities without spending dark elixir.\n7. Higher Frame Rate Option Check your phone settings for the higher frame rate option, which can enhance your Clash of Clans experience. By enabling this option, you can unlock a frame rate higher than the standard 60 frames per second.\n8. Troops Are Now 100% Free In recent updates, troops in the barracks are now 100% free. Instead of displaying costs, the barracks now indicate the housing space required for each troop. This change applies to spells and Siege machines as well.\n9. The Trader – Weekly Reset and Raid Medals The Trader, a shop where you can purchase various items, including magic items, now resets every week instead of daily. You can obtain raid medals by participating in raids during the weekend, which can be used to purchase items from the second tab in the Trader shop.\n10. Clan Capital and Clan Raids The Clan Capital is a new feature accessed through the Airship next to the Builder Base. It functions as a clan village where different districts can be upgraded by the clan. Clan Raids take place on weekends and involve attacking other clans using specific troops for this game mode. At the end of the week, you earn raid medals and can spend them at the Trader shop.\n11. Pets – Assigning Pets to Heroes At Town Hall 14, you unlock the pet house, allowing you to assign pets to your heroes. These pets have unique abilities and accompany your heroes in battles. As you upgrade the pet house, you unlock additional pets, providing new strategies and tactics for your attacks.\n12. Magic Items – Books, Potions, and More Magic items have become a valuable asset in Clash of Clans. These items can be obtained through various means such as the Trader shop, season pass, and Clan War Leagues. They offer advantages like boosting training times, instantly finishing upgrades, and more. Keep an eye on your magic items inventory in the town hall.\n13. Clan War Leagues and League Shop Clan War Leagues are week-long clan wars where clans of similar skill levels compete. Participating clans earn medals, which can be spent at the League Shop. This shop offers powerful magic items, including hammers that instantly complete upgrades.\n14. Practice Mode – Tutorials and Free Loot Practice mode is a valuable resource for learning new armies and strategies. Each level provides tutorials on different armies and offers free loot as a bonus. Even if a tutorial doesn’t apply to your current Town Hall level, it’s worth completing for the loot rewards.\n15. Siege Machines – Special Weapons for Attacking Siege machines are powerful tools designed to transport and deploy troops during attacks. Unlocked at Town Hall 12, they can be requested in the clan castle and come filled with troops. When destroyed, they release the troops into battle. Siege machines can be useful for breaking through walls and wreaking havoc on enemy bases.\nConclusion Returning to Clash of Clans after a break can be overwhelming, but by understanding these 17 important updates and features, you’ll be able to catch up quickly and make the most of your gaming experience. From upgraded villages to new troops, spells, and magic items, there’s a lot to discover and enjoy. So dust off your base, join the battle, and have fun in Clash of Clans once again!\n","wordCount":"1107","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Margaret Dempsey"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/league-when-is-clash-coming-back/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tech Posts","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tech-posts.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Tech Posts (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tech-posts.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tech Posts</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tech-posts.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>17 Important Things To Know If You Just Returned To Clash of Clans</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 10, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1107 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Margaret Dempsey</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#key-points>Key Points:</a></li><li><a href=#step-by-step-guide>Step-by-Step Guide:</a><ul><li><a href=#1-returning-to-an-upgraded-village>1.
