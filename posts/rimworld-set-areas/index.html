Zones are player-created sections of the map that can be used to restrict the movement of colonists and pets. By properly setting up and managing zones, you can optimize your colony’s efficiency and ensure their well-being. In this guide, we will cover the basics of creating and managing zones, as well as discuss some common zone setups that can be beneficial for your RimWorld playthroughs.\nUnderstanding Zones Zones in RimWorld are areas on the map that you can designate for specific purposes. These areas can be used to restrict the movement of colonists and pets, ensuring that they stay within certain boundaries. This can be crucial for keeping your people safe and preventing them from wandering into dangerous areas. Zones can also be used to improve efficiency by limiting the areas where colonists perform certain tasks.\nCreating Zones To create a zone in RimWorld, follow these steps:\nClick on the “Architect” tab. Click on the “Zone” button in the top right corner. Select “Expand Allowed Area” and then click on “Manage Areas.” In the “Manage Areas” menu, you will see a list of all the zones you have already created. To create a new zone, click on “New Area.” A new zone will appear with a default name and a random color. Click on “Rename” to choose a name for the zone. Click on “Invert” to invert the entire zone, allowing everything except the designated area. Click on the red X to delete the zone entirely. Placing Zones Once you have created a zone, you can designate it on the map by following these steps:\nGo back to the “Expand Allowed Areas” menu. Instead of clicking on “Manage Areas,” click on the zone you want to place. Choose the color overlay and drag it over the area where you want to restrict colonists and pets. Anything not highlighted by the color overlay will be forbidden for them to enter. Restricting Colonists and Pets to Zones After creating and placing a zone, you can restrict colonists and pets to it by following these steps:\nTo restrict colonists, click on the “Restrict” button at the bottom and choose the desired zone from the list. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor to select all colonists you want to assign to the zone. To restrict pets, go to the “Animal” tab and repeat the same process. Once assigned to a zone, colonists and pets will not leave unless manually moved or in case of a breakdown. Common Zone Setups Now that you understand how to create and use zones in RimWorld, let’s explore some common zone setups that can benefit your colony:\nInside the Walls: This defensive zone ensures that all colonists and pets quickly gather in a safe area, especially during raids or hostile animal encounters. It is advisable to create this zone early in your game. Work Zone: By designating specific areas where colonists can perform tasks, you can prevent them from wandering all over the map. Add temporary work zones for specific activities and adjust them as needed. Avoid Danger Zone: Create this zone to forbid colonists and pets from entering dangerous areas, such as near mech turrets or the edge of the map where raids commonly occur. Grazing Animals Zone: Separate grazing animals from hauling animals to maintain cleanliness and prevent them from damaging crops or entering restricted areas. Start with a full invert and delete specific parts as needed. Emergency or Triage Zone: In case of severe injuries during battles, create an emergency zone with medical sleeping spots. Restrict the doctor and the patient to this zone until the patient is stable enough to be transported back to the base. Animal Attack Zone: Send animals to attack enemies or absorb hits during raids. Use this zone strategically to protect your shooters and eliminate threats effectively. Fallout Zone: During toxic fallout events, create a zone to keep colonists and animals indoors to avoid poisoning. Consider setting separate zones for animals based on their dietary needs and provide temporary roofing along paths for additional protection. Hospital Zone: For injured colonists who are able to walk, create a small hospital zone to restrict their movement. Place a table, chairs, and meals in this area to prevent starvation and mood debuffs. Conclusion Zones are a powerful tool in RimWorld that can greatly improve your colony’s safety, efficiency, and overall management. By understanding how to create and use zones effectively, you can optimize your game strategy and ensure the well-being of your colonists and pets. Try experimenting with different zone setups based on your gameplay style and preferences. Whether you choose to use a few key zones or micromanage each colonist’s individual zone, the flexibility and benefits of this feature are undeniable. Implementing zones in your RimWorld playthroughs is highly recommended for a more immersive and satisfying experience.\nWe hope this guide has provided you with valuable insights into using zones in RimWorld.
